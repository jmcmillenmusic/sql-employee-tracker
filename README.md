# SQL-Employee-Tracker

## Description

As a web developer, I need to be able to work with actual databases. While JSON objects could suffice, an actual database would be much better practice. As such, I've begun to dabble in SQL (Structured Query Language), and it was through this language that I was able to craft an Employee Tracker to be able to create, read, update, and delete data from a company's employee database.

## Installation

To access the README Generator, you'll need to clone the repo at the link below:
https://github.com/jmcmillenmusic/sql-employee-tracker
You'll need to make sure that you also have Inquirer v.8.2.4, the MySQL Node package, and Express by running the following commands in the terminal:
`npm i install@8.2.4`
`npm i express`
`npm i mysql`
Then, you'll need to initialize all of these using the following command in the terminal:
`npm init`

## Usage

To access the database and manipulate its data, run the following command in the terminal:
`node index.js`
Then, select any of the queries on the list to view departments, roles, and employees as well as add new departments, roles, and employees and also update employee roles. 
You can watch this video to see the employee tracker in action:
